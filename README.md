### ‚úèÔ∏è Todolist

<details><summary><b>‚úîÔ∏è Java Stdin and Stdout I</b></summary>

<b>Task</b>

In this challenge, you must read <b>3</b> integers from stdin and then print them to stdout. Each integer must be printed on a new line.

<details><summary><b>‚úîÔ∏è Java If-Else</b></summary>

<b>Task</b>

Given an integer, <b>n</b>, perform the following conditional actions:

- If <b>n</b> is odd, print <b>Weird</b>
- If <b>n</b> is even and in the inclusive range of <b>2</b> to <b>5</b>, print <b>Not Weird</b>
- If <b>n</b> is even and in the inclusive range of <b>6</b> to <b>20</b>, print <b>Weird</b>
- If <b>n</b> is even and greater than <b>20</b>, print <b>Not Weird</b>
Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not  is weird.

<b>Explanation</b>

Sample Case 0: <b>n = 3</b>
<b>n</b> is odd and odd numbers are weird, so we print `Weird`.

Sample Case 1: <b>n = 24</b>
<b>n > 20</b> and <b>n</b> is even, so it isn't weird. Thus, we print `Not Weird`.
